If you’re new to Decentralized Finance (DeFi) cryptocurrency, you’re in the right place. Our Peachfolio help guides will give you all the information you need to buy and sell Peachfolio tokens.

## What is DeFi cryptocurrency?

In short, Decentralized Finance is a blockchain-based form of finance. The aim of DeFi is to create a type of trading that doesn’t rely on traditional financial institutions like brokerages or banks.

Some examples of the financial activities you can do on DeFi platforms are trading cryptocurrencies and earning interest in savings-like accounts

A key concept in DeFi is the [smart contract](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/smart-contracts/). These are automated agreements that let you exchange cryptocurrency without a middleman. Smart contracts define the rules of the agreement and automatically enforce them.

The most popular DeFi platform right now is [Pancakeswap](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/). There are other platforms, but our help guides will cover how to buy and sell on Pancakeswap.

## How do I get started?

To start trading DeFi coins, there are a few things you’ll need to do first. It can get a little complicated, but stick with it - we’re right here to walk you through it.

This is what you need to do to get up and running:

* Step 1: Buy some [BNB coin](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-bnb) from Binance.com.
* Step 2: Create a wallet for trading. We recommend using either the [Trust Wallet app](https://trustwallet.com/) or [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), which is available as an app or Chrome extension.
* Step 3: Transfer BNB to your wallet.
* Step 4: Connect your wallet to Pancakeswap.
* Step 5: Add peachfolio to your list of coins.
* Step 6: Buy!
